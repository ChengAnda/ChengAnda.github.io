Hi there! I am Anda Cheng (程安达), currently serving as an Algorithm Expert at Ant Group. My research interests encompass LLMs, AI agents, and trustworthy AI. I received my Ph.D. from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) in 2023, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Jian Cheng](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~chengjian). Prior to that, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from Northeastern University in 2017.
